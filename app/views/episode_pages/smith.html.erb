		<h4 class="hub_para">About the Smith Lecture</h4>

		<p class="hub_para">Established by a generous gift from Mr. Stan and Mrs. Paula Warmath, long-time friends and associates of Dr. James C. Smith, the annual lecture features an invited internationally renowned speaker who is conducting behaviorally oriented research on scientific problems in neuroscience. The Warmathsâ€™ gift, coupled with continuing donations from other friends, former students, and colleagues of Dr. Smith, as well as support from the Department of Psychology and the Program in Neuroscience, provides the opportunity for FSU faculty and students to interact with these distinguished scholars during their visits to campus.</p>

Smith was also the recipient of the University Distinguished Teacher Award based on a lifetime of teaching excellence, and in 2005 the College of Arts and Sciences honored Dr. Smith as their Graduate of Distinction. Dr. Smith has also received international recognition for his scientific achievements including The Distinguished Career Award from the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior, a National Sigma Xi Lectureship, and the Mozell Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Chemical Senses from the Association for Chemoreception Sciences.
