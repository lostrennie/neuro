			<h4>About the Smith Lecture</h4>

			<p>Established by a generous gift from Mr. Stan and Mrs. Paula Warmath, long-time friends and associates of Dr. James C. Smith, the annual lecture features an invited internationally renowned speaker who is conducting behaviorally oriented research on scientific problems in neuroscience. The Warmaths’ gift, coupled with continuing donations from other friends, former students, and colleagues of Dr. Smith, as well as support from the Department of Psychology and the Program in Neuroscience, provides the opportunity for FSU faculty and students to interact with these distinguished scholars during their visits to campus.</p>
